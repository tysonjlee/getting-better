# Getting Better 

Getting Better is a simple note-taking web app focused on mental health self-reflection. Created as a personal project for my own healing, it encourages you to capture negative thoughts or feelings in the moment, saving them as notes to revisit and respond to for perspective.

The documentation below is mainly for my personal use :p

## v0.1 - MVP (I) 
- Display user's saved notes (no save persistence)
- Save a note 

## v0.2 - MVP (II)
- Save persistence (locally store user's notes)
- Visual notes
- Note deletion
